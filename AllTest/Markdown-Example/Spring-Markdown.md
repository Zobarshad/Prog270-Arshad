# Spring Is Here

## Spring Is Here

### Spring Is Here:


>“Never cut a tree down in the wintertime. Never make a negative decision in the low time. Never make your most important decisions when you are in your worst moods. Wait. Be patient. The storm will pass. The spring will come.” — Robert H. Schuller

 Names of Beautiful Flowers:

- Tulip
- Daffodils
- Rose
- hydrangea




           For winter's rains and ruins are over,
           And all the season of snows and sins;
           The days dividing lover and lover,
           The light that loses, the night that wins;
           And time remembered is grief forgotten,
           And frosts are slain and flowers begotten,
           And in green underwood and cover
           Blossom by blossom the spring begins.
           Algernon Charles Swinburne  (1837–1909)




Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough.
